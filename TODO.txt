- convert to GitHub actions
- remove chaining like `push(..).blank().push(..)
- look into the prior usage of the 'debug' package

later:
- use prettier for js languages (and more?)
- add option to curl for minifying json

changelog:

Breaking:
- dropps support for node versions less than 16.13
- the `http` target changed its client ID to `http1.1` from `1.1`
- formatter strings (i.e. "%s" substitutions) are no longer supported (now that template strings exist, you don't need them, so please just send the string you want as the line of code as-is)
- the "dot-method-train" style API is no longer supported on the CodeBuilder.  All the same functionality exists, but just call the methods separately.  For example instead of `push('a').blank().push('b')`  just do `push('a'); blank(); push('b');`
- the JavaScript target will output ES6 code
